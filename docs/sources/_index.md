Grafana OnCall is an open source incident response management tool built to help teams improve their collaboration and
resolve incidents faster. Some of the core strengths of Grafana OnCall include:

- **Support for a broad set of monitoring systems:** Grafana OnCall supports integrations with many monitoring systems,
  including Grafana, Prometheus, Alertmanager, Zabbix, and more.
- **Reduce alert noise:** Automatic alert grouping helps avoid alert storms and reduce noise during incidents.
  Auto-resolve settings can resolve without human intervention when the resolve conditions are met, enabling you to
  control alert noise and reduce alert fatigue.
- **Automatic escalation to on-call rotations:** Grafana OnCall’s flexible calendar integration allows you to define
  your on-call rotations while managing on-call schedules in your preferred calendar application with iCal format.
  Configurable alert escalation automatically escalates alerts to on-call team members, notifies slack channels, and more.
- **ChatOps focused:** Grafana OnCall integrates closely with your slack workspace to deliver alert notifications to
  individuals and groups, making daily alerts more visible and easier to manage.
- **Highly customizable**: With customizable alert grouping and routing, you can decide which alerts you want to be
  notified of and how, ensuring the right people are notified for the right issues.
- **Massive scalability:** Grafana OnCall is equipped with a full API and Terraform capabilities. Ready for GitOps
  and large organization configuration.
