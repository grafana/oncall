# Grafana OnCall

You can use Grafana OnCall to connect to the monitoring systems of your Grafana Cloud integrations so that you can ensure alert notifications reach the right people, at the right time, using the right medium. Team members can review and manage alert group notifications directly in OnCall, or in supported platforms, like Telegram and Slack.

When you integrate an alert monitoring system with Grafana OnCall, the alerts will create an alert group. This group will fire notifications that are sent according to escalation policies that you define in routes and escalation chains. You can configure escalation actions, and automatically notify users and groups through services like Slack, by text message, and by phone call. You can also use popular calendar services like Google Calendar and Outlook to schedule on-call shifts for team members.
