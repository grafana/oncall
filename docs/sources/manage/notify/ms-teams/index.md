# MS Teams integration for Grafana OnCall

The Microsoft Teams integration for Grafana OnCall embeds your MS Teams channels directly into your incident response
workflow to help your team focus on alert resolution.

Integrating MS Teams with Grafana OnCall allows users to be notified of alerts directly in MS Teams with automated escalation
steps and user notification preferences. Users can also take action on alerts directly from MS Teams, including
acknowledge, unacknowledge, resolve, and silence.
