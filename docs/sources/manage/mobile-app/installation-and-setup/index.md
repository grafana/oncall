### Where can I find my QR code?

To access your QR code:

1. Open Grafana OnCall from your desktop
1. Navigate to the **Users** tab, then tap **View my profile**
1. tap **Mobile app connection** in your profile

> **Note**: The QR code will timeout for security purposes - Screenshots of the QR code are unlikely to work for authentication.

### Connect to your open source Grafana OnCall account

Grafana OnCall OSS relies on Grafana Cloud OnCall as on relay for push notifications.
You must first connect your Grafana OnCall OSS to Grafana Cloud OnCall for the mobile app to work.

To connect to Grafana Cloud OnCall, refer to the Cloud page in your OSS Grafana OnCall instance.

For Grafana OnCall OSS, the QR code includes an authentication token along with a backend URL.
Your Grafana OnCall OSS instance should be reachable from the same network as your mobile device, preferably from the internet.

### Connect to multiple OnCall stacks

The OnCall mobile app provides a seamless experience for managing multiple OnCall stacks/accounts.

With just a few taps, you can add and switch between different stacks, ensuring you have access to all your alerts and schedules
without the need to log in and out repeatedly.
This feature is designed to support professionals managing multiple projects or working across different teams, enhancing efficiency and response times.

Simply navigate to the settings menu, select the account tile, tap on the + icon and scan the QR code of the stack you wish to connect.

To switch stack, just select the one you wish to visualize from the accounts page.

Stay organized and responsive by managing all your OnCall needs in one place.
