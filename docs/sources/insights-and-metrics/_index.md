# Insight Logs

> **Note:** Grafana OnCall insight logs are available in Grafana Cloud only.
We're in the process of rolling out Insight Logs to all customers,
if you don't see insight logs in your Grafana Cloud stack, please reach out to support.

Grafana OnCall Insights Logs represents certain activities, such as when:

- A user creates, updates, or deletes a resource.
- A Maintenance mode is started or finished for an integration.
- A user configures a ChatOps integration.

This configuration is done for you in Grafana Cloud with [Usage Insights Loki data source](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/billing-and-usage/usage-insights/#usage-insights-loki-data-source).
You can use this query to retrieve all logs related to your OnCall instance.

```logql
{instance_type="oncall"} | logfmt | __error__=``
```

## Resource insight logs

Logs are created each time a user modifies any resource in Grafana OnCall.

These logs will have `action_type=resource` field and can be retrieved with following query:

```logql
{instance_type="oncall"} | logfmt | __error__=`` | action_type = `resource`
```

### Format

Logs contain the following fields, where the fields followed by * are always available, and the others depend on the logged event:

| Field Name            |                                 Description                                  |

## Examples

Here is some examples of practical queries to Grafana OnCall insight logs.
LogQL is used to retrieve them. If you are not familiar with LogQL check this [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/).

Resource IDs are used a lot in insight logs. You can find them in web ui (example for integration):

1. Open Grafana OnCall.
2. Navigate to resource.
3. The URL looks like `https://<YOUR_STACK_SLUG>/a/grafana-oncall-app/integrations/C5VXMIFKKP67K`.
4. Integration ID is `C5VXMIFKKP67K`.

Alternatively you can find resource ID using public [API](https://grafana.com/docs/oncall/latest/oncall-api-reference/) or browser dev tools.

Actions performed by user:

```logql
{instance_type="oncall"} | logfmt | __error__=`` | action_type = `resource` and author="<username>"
```

Actions performed with all schedules:

```logql
{instance_type="oncall"} | logfmt | __error__=`` | action_type = `resource` and (resource_type=`web_schedule` or resource_type=`calendar_schedule` or resource_type=`ical_schedule`)
```

Changes of escalation policies for escalation chain:

```logql
{instance_type="oncall"} | logfmt | __error__=`` | action_type = `resource` and resource_type=`escalation_policy` and escalation_chain_id=`<ESCALATION_CHAIN_ID>`
```

Maintenance events for integration:

```logql
{instance_type="oncall"} | logfmt | __error__=`` | action_type = `maintenance` and resource_id=`CSA67IQW2NMVL`
```

Actions performed with slack chatops integration:

```logql
{instance_type="oncall"} | logfmt | __error__=`` | action_type = `chat_ops` and chat_ops_type=`slack`
```
