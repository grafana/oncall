# Insight Logs and Metrics

## Insight Logs

> **Note:** Grafana OnCall insight logs are available in Grafana Cloud only.
We're in the process of rolling out Insight Logs to all customers,
if you don't see insight logs in your Grafana Cloud stack, please reach out to support.

Grafana OnCall Insights Logs represents certain activities, such as when:

- A user creates, updates, or deletes a resource.
- A Maintenance mode is started or finished for an integration.
- A user configures a ChatOps integration.

This configuration is done for you in Grafana Cloud with [Usage Insights Loki data source](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/billing-and-usage/usage-insights/#usage-insights-loki-data-source).
You can use this query to retrieve all logs related to your OnCall instance.

```logql
{instance_type="oncall"} | logfmt | __error__=``
```

### Resource insight logs

Logs are created each time a user modifies any resource in Grafana OnCall.

These logs will have `action_type=resource` field and can be retrieved with following query:

```logql
{instance_type="oncall"} | logfmt | __error__=`` | action_type = `resource`
```

#### Format

Logs contain the following fields, where the fields followed by * are always available, and the others depend on the logged event:

| Field Name            |                                 Description                                  |

### Examples

Here is some examples of practical queries to Grafana OnCall insight logs.
LogQL is used to retrieve them. If you are not familiar with LogQL check this [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/).

Resource IDs are used a lot in insight logs. You can find them in web ui (example for integration):

1. Open Grafana OnCall.
2. Navigate to resource.
3. The URL looks like `https://<YOUR_STACK_SLUG>/a/grafana-oncall-app/integrations/C5VXMIFKKP67K`.
4. Integration ID is `C5VXMIFKKP67K`.

Alternatively you can find resource ID using public [API](https://grafana.com/docs/oncall/latest/oncall-api-reference/) or browser dev tools.

Actions performed by user:

```logql
{instance_type="oncall"} | logfmt | __error__=`` | action_type = `resource` and author="<username>"
```

Actions performed with all schedules:

```logql
{instance_type="oncall"} | logfmt | __error__=`` | action_type = `resource` and (resource_type=`web_schedule` or resource_type=`calendar_schedule` or resource_type=`ical_schedule`)
```

Changes of escalation policies for escalation chain:

```logql
{instance_type="oncall"} | logfmt | __error__=`` | action_type = `resource` and resource_type=`escalation_policy` and escalation_chain_id=`<ESCALATION_CHAIN_ID>`
```

Maintenance events for integration:

```logql
{instance_type="oncall"} | logfmt | __error__=`` | action_type = `maintenance` and resource_id=`CSA67IQW2NMVL`
```

Actions performed with slack chatops integration:

```logql
{instance_type="oncall"} | logfmt | __error__=`` | action_type = `chat_ops` and chat_ops_type=`slack`
```

## Metrics

Grafana OnCall Metrics represents certain parameters, such as:

- A total count of alert groups for each integration in every state (firing, acknowledged, resolved, silenced).
It is a gauge, and its name has the suffix `alert_groups_total`
- Response time on alert groups for each integration (mean time between the start and first action of all alert groups
for the last 7 days in selected period). It is a histogram, and its name has the suffix `alert_groups_response_time`
with the histogram suffixes such as `_bucket`, `_sum` and `_count`

More information about metrics types you can find in the [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types).

To retrieve Prometheus metrics use PromQL. If you are not familiar with PromQL, check this [documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/).

### For Grafana Cloud customers

OnCall application metrics are collected in preinstalled `grafanacloud_usage` datasource and are available for every
cloud instance.

Metrics have prefix `grafanacloud_oncall_instance`, e.g. `grafanacloud_oncall_instance_alert_groups_total` and
`grafanacloud_oncall_instance_alert_groups_response_time_seconds_bucket`.

### For open source customers

To collect OnCall application metrics you need to set up Prometheus and add it to your Grafana instance as a datasource.
You can find more information about Prometheus setup in the [OSS documentation](https://github.com/grafana/oncall#readme)

Metrics have prefix `oncall`, e.g. `oncall_alert_groups_total` and `oncall_alert_groups_response_time_seconds_bucket`.

Your metrics also may have additional labels, such as `pod`, `instance`, `container`, depending on your Prometheus setup.

### Metric Alert groups total

This metric has the following labels:

| Label Name    |                                 Description                                   |
|---------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `id`          | ID of Grafana instance (stack)                                                |
| `slug`        | Slug of Grafana instance (stack)                                              |
| `org_id`      | ID of Grafana organization                                                    |
| `team`        | Team name                                                                     |
| `integration` | OnCall Integration name                                                       |
| `state`       | Alert groups state. May be `firing`, `acknowledged`, `resolved` and `silenced`|

**Query example:**

Get the number of alert groups in "firing" state in integration "Grafana Alerting" in Grafana stack "test_stack":

```promql
grafanacloud_oncall_instance_alert_groups_total{slug="test_stack", integration="Grafana Alerting", state="firing"}
```

### Metric Alert groups response time

This metric has the following labels:

| Label Name    |                                 Description                                    |
|---------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `id`          | ID of Grafana instance (stack)                                                 |

| `integration` | OnCall Integration name                                                        |
| `le`          | Histogram bucket value in seconds. May be `60`, `300`, `600`, `3600` and `+Inf`|

**Query example:**

Get the number of alert groups with response time more than 10 minutes (600 seconds) in integration "Grafana Alerting"
in Grafana stack "test_stack":

```promql
grafanacloud_oncall_instance_alert_groups_response_time_seconds_bucket{slug="test_stack", integration="Grafana Alerting", le="600"}
```

### Dashboard

To import OnCall metrics dashboard go to `Administration` -> `Plugins` page, find OnCall in the plugins list, open
`Dashboards` tab at the OnCall plugin settings page and click "Import" near "OnCall metrics". After that you can find
the "OnCall metrics" dashboard in your dashboards list. In the datasource dropdown select your Prometheus datasource
(for Cloud customers it's `grafanacluod_usage`). You can filter data by your Grafana instances, teams and integrations.

To update the dashboard to the newest version go to `Dashboards` tab at the OnCall plugin settings page and click
“Re-import”.
Be aware: if you have made changes to the dashboard, they will be deleted after re-importing. To save your changes go
to the dashboard settings, click "Save as" and save a copy of the dashboard.
