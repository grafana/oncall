### Where can I find my QR code?

1. Navigate to the **Users** tab, then tap **View my profile**
1. tap **Mobile app connection** in your profile

> **Note**: The QR code will timeout for security purposes - Screenshots of the QR code are unlikely to work for authentication.

### Connect to your open source Grafana OnCall account

Grafana OnCall OSS relies on Grafana Cloud OnCall as on relay for push notifications.
You must first connect your Grafana OnCall OSS to Grafana Cloud OnCall for the mobile app to work.

To connect to Grafana Cloud OnCall, refer to the Cloud page in your OSS Grafana OnCall instance.

For Grafana OnCall OSS, the QR code includes an authentication token along with a backend URL.
Your Grafana OnCall OSS instance should be reachable from the same network as your mobile device, preferably from the internet.
