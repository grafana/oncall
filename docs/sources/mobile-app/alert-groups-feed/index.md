# Alert Groups feed

On the **Feed** page, you can view Alert groups, under two tabs:

- **Mine** shows Alert Groups that involve you in one way or another. E.g. because a notification went to you about it, or you resolved it.
- **All** shows all Alert Groups, including ones that may not be relevant to you.

You can filter by status via the **filter** button on the top right.  We are working on an expansion for this filter, to filter by team, integration name, and more.

Tap on any Alert Group to go to the detailed view.  This page also provides links for opening in slack and sharing the link to this alert group.
