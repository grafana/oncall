# On-call status and shifts

On the **Feed** page, your avatar on top of the screen indicates whether you are oncall, will be on call soon, or not.
Tap it to open the **upcoming shifts** view.  This view displays:

- your current shift (if any), per schedule.
- your next upcoming shift (if any), per schedule.  This only looks up to 31 days into the future.
