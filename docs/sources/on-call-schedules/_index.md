## Before you begin

- Users with Admin or Editor roles can create, edit and delete schedules.
- Users with Viewer role cannot receive alert notifications, therefore, cannot be on-call.

For more information about permissions, refer to
[Manage users and teams for Grafana OnCall][user-and-team-management]

### Web-based schedule

Configure and manage on-call schedules directly in the Grafana OnCall plugin. Easily configure and preview rotations,
see teammates' time zones, and add overrides.

Learn more about [Web-based schedules][web-schedule]

### iCal import

Use any calendar service that uses the iCal format to manage and customize on-call schedules - Import rotations and
shifts from your calendar app to Grafana OnCall for widely accessible scheduling. iCal imports appear in Grafana
OnCall as read-only schedules but can be leveraged similarly to a web-based schedule.

### Terraform

Use the Grafana OnCall Terraform provider to manage schedules within your “as-code” workflow. Rotations configured
via Terraform are automatically added to your schedules in Grafana OnCall. Similar to the iCal import, these schedules
read-only and cannot be edited from the UI.

To learn more, read our [Get started with Grafana OnCall and Terraform](
<https://grafana.com/blog/2022/08/29/get-started-with-grafana-oncall-and-terraform/>) blog post.

### Shift swap requests

Sometimes you may need someone to cover your scheduled on-call shifts (e.g. you are going on vacation
for a couple of weeks). You can then create a shift swap request, which will let your teammates
know about this as well as allowing them to volunteer and take your affected shifts for that period.
