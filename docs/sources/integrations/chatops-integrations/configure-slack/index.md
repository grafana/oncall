# Slack integration for Grafana OnCall

The Slack integration for Grafana OnCall incorporates your Slack workspace directly into your incident response workflow to help your team focus on alert resolution with less friction.

Integrating your Slack workspace with Grafana OnCall allows users and teams to be notified of alerts directly in Slack with automated alert escalation steps and user notification preferences. There are a number of alert actions that users can take directly from Slack, including acknowledge, resolve, add resolution notes, and more.


## Before you begin

To install the Slack integration, you must have Admin permissions in your Grafana instance as well as the Slack workspace that youâ€™d like to integrate with.

For Open Source Grafana OnCall Slack installation guidance, refer to [Open Source Grafana OnCall]({{< relref "../../../open-source/" >}}).

1. When an on-call shift notification is sent to a person or channel, click the gear icon to access **Notifications preferences**.
2. Configure on-call notifications for future shift notifications.
