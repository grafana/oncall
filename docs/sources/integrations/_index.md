# Grafana OnCall integrations

Integrations allow you to connect monitoring systems of your choice to send alerts to Grafana OnCall. Regardless of where your alerts originate, you can configure alerts to be sent to Grafana OnCall for alert escalation and notification. Grafana OnCall receives alerts in JSON format via a POST request, OnCall then parses alert data using preconfigured alert templates to determine alert grouping, apply routes, and determine correct escalation.

There are many integrations that are directly supported by Grafana OnCall. Those that aren’t currently listed in the Integrations menu can be connected using the webhook integration and configured alert templates.

## Configure and manage integrations
