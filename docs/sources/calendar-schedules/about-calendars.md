# About Grafana OnCall scheduling

You can use any calendar with an iCal address to schedule on-call times for users. During these times, notifications configured in escalation chains with the **Notify users from an on-call schedule** setting will be sent to the the person scheduled. You can also schedule multiple users for overlapping times, and assign prioritization labels for the user that you would like to notify.

When you create a schedule, you will be able to select a Slack channel, associated with your OnCall account, that will notify users when there are errors or notifications regarding the assigned on-call shifts.
