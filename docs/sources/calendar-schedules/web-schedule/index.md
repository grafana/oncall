# About web-based schedules 

Grafana OnCall allows you to map out recurring on-call coverage and automate the escalation of alert notifications to on-call users. Configure and manage on-call schedules directly in the Grafana OnCall plugin to easily customize rotations with a live schedule preview, reference teammates' time zones, and add overrides. 

To learn more, refer to [Create an on-call schedule](create-schedule.md)


>**Note**: User permissions determine which components of Grafana OnCall are available to you.
