# Grafana Cloud Documentation

Source for documentation at <https://grafana.com/docs/oncall/>

## Preview the website

Run `make docs`. This launches a preview of the website with the current grafana docs at
`http://localhost:3002/docs/oncall/latest/` which will refresh automatically when changes are made to
content in the `sources` directory.
Make sure Docker is running.
