# Grafana Cloud Documentation

Source for documentation at https://grafana.com/docs/amixr/

## Preview the website

Run `make docs`. This launches a preview of the website with the current grafana docs at `http://localhost:3002/docs/amixr/` which will refresh automatically when changes are made to content in the `sources` directory.
Make sure Docker is running.
