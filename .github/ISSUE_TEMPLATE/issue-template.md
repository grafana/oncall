Hi, thank you for opening an issue!

Here is a quick checklist:
- [ ] Is it about Cloud or Open Source OnCall?
- [ ] Add OnCall backend & frontend versions.
- [ ] Include labels starting with "part:". Like `part:alertflow` or `part:schedules`.
- [ ] Include labels like `bug` or `feature request`.
- [ ] If it's a bug, include logs.
