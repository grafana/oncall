  # NOTE: unfortunately we need to store GH_APP_ID and GH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY as repository secrets
  # (even though we already store them in Vault), because GitHub does not allow passing the `token` output
  # of the `actions/create-github-app-token` action ACROSS jobs.
  #
  # Because grafana/helm-charts/.github/workflows/update-helm-repo.yaml is a reusable workflow, and not a composite
  # action, there is no way to run job steps before the reusable workflow to do so within the same job.
  #
  # see https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token/issues/66 for more details
