<p>We propose to set up PRTG to send heartbeat GET or POST requests to amixr endpoint to detect an outage of your
    monitoring system.<br/> You can write a script which does this and then run the script via an EXE/script Sensor.<br/>
    If you add this Sensor to the Core Server, Amixr will send an alert if the Core Server is offline.
