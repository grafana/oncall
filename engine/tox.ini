# From pytest-socket docs (https://github.com/miketheman/pytest-socket):
# A plugin to use with Pytest to disable or restrict socket calls during tests to ensure network calls are prevented
# --disable-socket = tests should fail on any access to socket or libraries using socket with a SocketBlockedErro
# --allow-unix-socket = to enable Unix sockets during the test run (e.g. for async), add this option
# --allow-hosts=oncall-dev-mariadb = allow connections to the given hostnames/IPs (in this case, or tests's MySQL database)
# NOTE: calendar.google.com is used for some tests (fetching a real iCal file), so it's allowed here
