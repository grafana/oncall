# Tests are grouped by module for test functions and by class for test methods.
# Groups are distributed to available workers as whole units. This guarantees that all tests in a group run in the same
# process. This can be useful if you have expensive module-level or class-level fixtures. Grouping by class takes
# priority over grouping by module.
