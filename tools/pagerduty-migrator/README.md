# PagerDuty to Grafana OnCall migrator tool

This tool helps to migrate your PagerDuty configuration to Grafana OnCall.

## Overview

Resources that can be migrated using this tool:

- User notification rules
- On-call schedules
- Escalation policies
- Services (integrations)
- Event rules (experimental, only works with global event rulesets)

## Limitations

- Not all integration types are supported
- Delays between migrated notification/escalation rules could be slightly different from original.
  E.g. if you have a 4-minute delay between rules in PagerDuty, the resulting delay in Grafana OnCall will be 5 minutes
- Manual changes to PD configuration may be required to migrate some resources

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have `docker` installed
2. Build the docker image: `docker build -t pd-oncall-migrator .`
3. Obtain a PagerDuty API **user token**: <https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/api-access-keys#generate-a-user-token-rest-api-key>
4. Obtain a Grafana OnCall API token and API URL on the "Settings" page of your Grafana OnCall instance

## Migration plan

Before starting the migration process, it's useful to see a migration plan by running the tool in `plan` mode:

```shell
docker run --rm \
-e PAGERDUTY_API_TOKEN="<PAGERDUTY_API_TOKEN>" \
-e ONCALL_API_URL="<ONCALL_API_URL>" \
-e ONCALL_API_TOKEN="<ONCALL_API_TOKEN>" \
-e MODE="plan" \
pd-oncall-migrator
```

Please read the generated report carefully since depending on the content of the report, some PagerDuty resources
could be not migrated and some existing Grafana OnCall resources could be deleted.

### Example migration plan

```text
User notification rules report:
    ✅ John Doe (john.doe@example.com) (existing notification rules will be deleted)
    ❌ Ben Thompson (ben@example.com) — no Grafana OnCall user found with this email

Schedule report:
    ✅ Support (existing schedule with name 'Support' will be deleted)
    ✅ Support-shadow
    ❌ DevOps — schedule references unmatched users
        ❌ Ben Thompson (ben@example.com) — no Grafana OnCall user found with this email

Escalation policy report:
    ✅ Support
    ❌ DevOps Escalation Policy — policy references unmatched users and schedules with unmatched users
        ❌ Ben Thompson (ben@example.com) — no Grafana OnCall user found with this email
        ❌ DevOps — schedule references unmatched users

Integration report:
    ✅ Support - Prometheus (existing integration with name 'Support - Prometheus' will be deleted)
    ❌ DevOps - Prometheus — escalation policy 'DevOps Escalation Policy' references unmatched users or schedules
    with unmatched users
    ❌ DevOps - Email — cannot find appropriate Grafana OnCall integration type
```

## Migration

Once you are happy with the migration report, start the migration by setting the `MODE` environment variable to `migrate`:

```shell
docker run --rm \
-e PAGERDUTY_API_TOKEN="<PAGERDUTY_API_TOKEN>" \
-e ONCALL_API_URL="<ONCALL_API_URL>" \
-e ONCALL_API_TOKEN="<ONCALL_API_TOKEN>" \
-e MODE="migrate" \
pd-oncall-migrator
```

When performing a migration, only resources that are marked with ✅ or ⚠️ on the plan stage will be migrated.
The migrator is designed to be idempotent, so it's safe to run it multiple times. On every migration run, the tool will
check if the resource already exists in Grafana OnCall and will delete it before creating a new one.

### Migrate unsupported integration types

It's possible to migrate unsupported integration types to [Grafana OnCall incoming webhooks](https://grafana.com/docs/oncall/latest/integrations/available-integrations/configure-webhook/).
To enable this feature, set env variable `UNSUPPORTED_INTEGRATION_TO_WEBHOOKS` to `true`:

```shell
docker run --rm \
-e PAGERDUTY_API_TOKEN="<PAGERDUTY_API_TOKEN>" \
-e ONCALL_API_URL="<ONCALL_API_URL>" \
-e ONCALL_API_TOKEN="<ONCALL_API_TOKEN>" \
-e UNSUPPORTED_INTEGRATION_TO_WEBHOOKS="true" \
-e MODE="migrate" \
pd-oncall-migrator
```

Consider modifying [alert templates](https://grafana.com/docs/oncall/latest/alert-behavior/alert-templates/) of the created
webhook integrations to adjust them for incoming payloads.

## Configuration

Configuration is done via environment variables passed to the docker container.

## Resources

### User notification rules

The tool is capable of migrating user notification rules from PagerDuty to Grafana OnCall.
Notification rules from the `"When a high-urgency incident is assigned to me..."` section in PagerDuty settings are
taken into account and will be migrated to default notification rules in Grafana OnCall for each user. Note that delays
between notification rules may be slightly different in Grafana OnCall, see [Limitations](#limitations) for more info.

When running the migration, existing notification rules in Grafana OnCall will be deleted for every affected user.

Note that users are matched by email, so if there are users in the report with "no Grafana OnCall user found with
this email" error, it's possible to fix it by adding these users to your Grafana organization.
If there is a large number of unmatched users, please also [see the script](scripts/README.md) that can automatically
create missing Grafana users via Grafana HTTP API.

### On-call schedules

The tool is capable of migrating on-call schedules from PagerDuty to Grafana OnCall.
There are two ways to migrate on-call schedules:

- Migrate on-call shifts as if they were created in Grafana OnCall web UI. Due to scheduling differences between
PagerDuty and Grafana OnCall, it's sometimes impossible to automatically migrate on-call shifts without manual changes
in PD. Pass `SCHEDULE_MIGRATION_MODE=web` to the tool to enable this mode.
- Using ICalendar file URLs from PagerDuty. This way it's always possible to migrate schedules without any manual
changes in PD, but resulting schedules in Grafana OnCall will be read-only. Pass `SCHEDULE_MIGRATION_MODE=ical` to the tool
to enable this mode.

On-call schedules will be migrated to new Grafana OnCall schedules with the same name as in PD. Any existing schedules
with the same name will be deleted before migration. Any on-call schedules that reference unmatched users won't be
migrated.

When running the plan with `SCHEDULE_MIGRATION_MODE=web`, there could be a number of errors regarding on-call schedules.
These errors are expected and are caused by the fact that the tool can't always automatically migrate on-call shifts
due to differences in scheduling systems in PD and Grafana OnCall. To fix these errors, you need to manually change
on-call shifts in PD and re-run the migration.

### Escalation policies

The tool is capable of migrating escalation policies from PagerDuty to Grafana OnCall.
Every escalation policy will be migrated to a new Grafana OnCall escalation chain with the same name.

Any existing escalation chains with the same name will be deleted before migration. Any escalation policies that reference
unmatched users or schedules that cannot be migrated won't be migrated as well.

Note that delays between escalation steps may be slightly different in Grafana OnCall,
see [Limitations](#limitations) for more info.

### Services (integrations)

The tool is capable of migrating services (integrations) from PagerDuty to Grafana OnCall.
For every service in PD, the tool will migrate all integrations to Grafana OnCall integrations.

Any services that reference escalation policies that cannot be migrated won't be migrated as well.
Any integrations with unsupported type won't be migrated unless `UNSUPPORTED_INTEGRATION_TO_WEBHOOKS` is set to `true`.

### Event rules (global event rulesets)

The tool is capable of migrating global event rulesets from PagerDuty to Grafana OnCall integrations. This feature is
experimental and disabled by default. To enable it, set `EXPERIMENTAL_MIGRATE_EVENT_RULES` to `true`.

For every ruleset in PD, the tool will create a webhook integration in Grafana OnCall. The tool will create
a route for every rule in ruleset, converting conditions in PD to Jinja2 routes in Grafana OnCall. The tool will also
select appropriate escalation chains for each route based on service referenced in the rule.

If you want to include service & integration names in the names of migrated integrations, set
`EXPERIMENTAL_MIGRATE_EVENT_RULES_LONG_NAMES` to `true` (note that this only applies when
`EXPERIMENTAL_MIGRATE_EVENT_RULES` is `true`). This can make searching for integrations easier,
but it can also make the names of integrations too long.

## After migration

- Connect integrations (press the "How to connect" button on the integration page)
- Make sure users connect their phone numbers, Slack accounts, etc. in their user settings
- When using `SCHEDULE_MIGRATION_MODE=ical`, at some point you would probably want to recreate schedules using
Google Calendar or Terraform to be able to modify migrated on-call schedules in Grafana OnCall
