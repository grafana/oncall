## Getting Started
OnCall consists of two parts:
1. OnCall backend
2. "Grafana OnCall" plugin you need to install in your Grafana

### How to run OnCall backend
1. An all-in-one image of OnCall is available on docker hub to run it:
```bash
docker run -it --name oncall-backend -p 8000:8000 grafana/oncall-all-in-one
```

2. When the image starts up you will see a message like this:
```bash
ðŸ‘‹ This script will issue an invite token to securely connect the frontend.
Maintainers will be happy to help in the slack channel #grafana-oncall: https://slack.grafana.com/
Your invite token: <TOKEN>, use it in the Grafana OnCall plugin.
```

3. If you started your container detached with -d check the log:
```bash
docker logs oncall-backend
```
